    "\n",
    "- An interpreter reads and translates the program line by line, like Python. And when we are running Python interactively, Python processes the line immediately and is ready for us to type another line of Python. Usually, it takes large amount time to finish the overall execution but analyzing the source code takes less time. In terms of debugging, it is easier for interpreters because it stops translating the program when the first error is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A compiler scans the entire program and translates it as a whole into machine code. Therefore, it takes large amount of time to analyze the source code but the overall execution time is shorter. And in this case, debugging is more difficult."
