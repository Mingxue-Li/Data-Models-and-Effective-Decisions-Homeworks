    "To render an expression using LaTex, the expression must be enclosed with dollar signs. For example, the expression `$X>0$` is rendered $X>0$. A single dollar sign is for mathematical expressions within the same line, and double dollar signs are for a standalone mathematical expressions in its own line. Hence, `$$X > 0.$$` is rendered as  $$X>0.$$\n"
